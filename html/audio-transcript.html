					</p>
					<p id="cvi-audio-transcript">“My vision is very unpredictable. It likes to do what it wants. It gets
						frustrating because I want to be able to see things, I want to be able to participate in things,
						but sometimes it’s hard for me because my vision just completely goes at the wrong time! For me,
						my vision can go from probably visually impaired to only seeing movement, light, shadows, and
						color... I guess kinda like Monet paintings. Very distorted. I wish people understood more that
						our brains decide when it wants to work, visually, and when it wants to “peace out”, I’m done
						for the day.”</p>
